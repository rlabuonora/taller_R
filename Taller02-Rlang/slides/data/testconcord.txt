The [1] here means that the first item in this line of output is
item 1. In this case, our output consists of only one line (and one
item), so this is redundant, but this notation helps to read
voluminous output that consists of many items spread over many
lines. For example, if there were two rows of output with six items
per row, the second row would be labeled [7].
